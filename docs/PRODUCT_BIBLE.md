## 1. What Is ASCEND

All-in-one fitness super-app: gym logging + nutrition + female health + running/cardio + martial arts + yoga + calisthenics + habits + health vitals + social/guilds + AI coaching + RPG gamification.

**Vision:** "Everything you need for your body, in one place."

2. **RPG gamification** — XP, levels, ranks (E→S, Solo Leveling inspired), skill trees, daily quests, seasons, boss battles, loot drops. Cosmetics earned, never purchased.
3. **Guild & class system** — discipline classes, guilds (50 max), guild XP/rankings/chat/co-op boss battles.
4. **AI Coach** — Claude Haiku with full user context. 10 msg/day free, unlimited premium. Always disclaimered.
5. **Sex-aware training** — dual-sex profiles, cycle integration, phase-adapted training, pregnancy/postpartum mode.
6. **One data ecosystem** — gym affects calorie budget, sleep adjusts training, nutrition correlates with PRs. Readiness score from sleep+recovery+mood+load.

## 3. Navigation System — Hub-and-Spoke

| **Social** | 👥 | Rankings, Achievements | Feed, Guilds, Challenges, Messages |
| **You** | 🧬 | Profile, Character, Settings, Discover | AI Coach, Goals |

### Module System (Progressive Disclosure)
- Users pick modules during onboarding
- Core modules (Gym, Progress, XP) always on
- "Discover" page to browse/enable modules anytime
- Smart suggestions after usage milestones

### Domain Color System

## 4. Drill-Down Pattern

Universal **browse → categorise → detail** (3-level) pattern. One reusable `DrilldownShell` component, different data sources.

| Domain | L1 (Browse) | L2 (Category) | L3 (Detail) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Martial Arts | Discipline list | Technique categories | Technique breakdown |
| Exercises | Body part | Muscle group | Exercise detail + video |
| Yoga | Style | Flow sequences | Pose alignment cues |
| Calisthenics | Skill family | Progression level | Hold detail + prerequisites |
| Recipes | Meal type | Filtered list | Recipe + macros + steps |

**DB tables:** `disciplines`, `technique_categories`, `techniques`, `user_technique_progress`

### Martial Arts Disciplines (5)
1. **Shaolin Kung Fu** — 🐉 China, 1500 yrs. Animal forms, conditioning, weapons. 6 categories, ~45 techniques.

## 5. UI Pattern Library

### Visual Direction: Glass Forge
Extend login page's glass morphism into the whole app. Frosted glass cards (`backdrop-blur-xl`), gradient borders, ambient glow on active elements. Domain colour system provides section identity.

### Component System
| Component | Description | When |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Glass card** | `backdrop-blur-xl`, `bg-white/[0.04]`, gradient border, subtle glow on hover | Primary container |
| **Stat chip** | Small pill: value + label, domain-coloured | Key numbers on Hub |
| **Progress ring** | SVG circular fill (calorie ring, XP bar, hydration) | Daily targets |
| **Drill-down list** | Rows: status badge + arrow + progress bar | Martial arts, exercises, yoga |
| **Timeline row** | Left-bordered card with timestamp | Activity feed, notifications |
| **Sub-nav pills** | Horizontal scrollable strip, domain-coloured active | Inside each tab |
| **Quick-action FAB** | Floating button → expandable menu | Start workout, log food |

### Typography
- **Space Grotesk** — headings and display numbers (tech/gaming feel)
- **Inter** — body text (clean readability)
- **JetBrains Mono** — data values only (weights, times, counts). Accent, not dominate.
- **Scale:** 10px captions → 12px body small → 14px body → 16px section → 18px chapter → 24px page → 32px hero

### Animation Principles (Framer Motion)
- Page transitions: slide right for drill-down, slide left for back
- Card entrance: stagger on scroll
- Micro-interactions: button press scale(0.97), toggle bounce
- Celebration: PR confetti, boss defeated animation, level up glow burst
- Rule: every animation communicates state change — no gratuitous motion

## 6. Database Architecture

**Current:** 14 migrations, ~15 tables.

### Growth by Phase
| Phase | Cumulative Tables | New Tables |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Current | 15 | — |
| Phase 1 | 20 | user_modules, water_logs, body_measurements, user_habits, habit_logs |
| Phase 2 | 33 | friendships, guilds, guild_members, activity_feed, activity_likes, activity_comments, challenges, challenge_participants, daily_quests, skill_tree_nodes, user_skill_progress, cosmetics, user_cosmetics |
| Phase 3 | 44 | coach_conversations, disciplines, technique_categories, techniques, user_technique_progress, periodisation_suggestions, recipes, recipe_ratings, seasons, season_rewards, user_season_progress |
| Phase 4 | 56 | run_sessions, swim_sessions, sleep_logs, mood_logs, meditation_logs, progress_photos, meal_plan_entries, fasting_logs, messages, conversations, boss_battles, boss_battle_attempts |
| Phase 5 | 68 | wearable_connections, blood_work, blood_work_results, vitals_logs, coach_profiles, coaching_sessions, forum_posts, forum_replies, forum_votes, events, event_rsvps, gym_reviews |

### Schema Rules
1. Every table has `user_id` + RLS policy
2. Weights always stored in kg
3. Dates as DATE for daily logs
4. JSON columns for flexible structured data
5. Soft deletes (`deleted_at`) for user content
6. Indexes on `(user_id, date)` for all log tables
7. No cross-user data access without explicit friendship/guild checks

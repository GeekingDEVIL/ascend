## Phased Roadmap (Section 16)

| Phase | Name | Timeline | Key Features |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Solidify core | Sep–Oct 2026 | 5-tab nav, module system, glass UI, DB achievements, water tracker, habits, measurements, legal docs |
| 2 | Social & gamification | Nov–Dec 2026 | Friends, activity feed, workout sharing, guilds, challenges, daily quests, character sheet, skill trees, cosmetics |
| 3 | Intelligence & content | Jan–Mar 2027 | AI Coach chat, NL food log, plateau detection, auto-periodisation, martial arts guides, calisthenics, premium launch, Season 1 |
| 4 | Expand domains | Apr–Jun 2027 | GPS running, cycling, yoga, sleep tracker, mood tracker, progress photos, barcode scanner, DMs, guild chat, boss battles |
| 5 | Go native & scale | Jul–Oct 2027 | Capacitor wrapper, Apple Health, Google Fit, form analysis, smart programs, coach marketplace, forums, app store launch |

**Priority rule**: Retention before acquisition. Social (Phase 2) keeps users. AI (Phase 3) justifies premium. Content (3-4) broadens audience. Native (5) unlocks app stores.

## Database Growth

| Phase | Cumulative Tables |
|-------|-------------------|
| Current | ~15 |
| + Phase 1 | 20 |
| + Phase 2 | 33 |
| + Phase 3 | 44 |
| + Phase 4 | 56 |
| + Phase 5 | 68 |

**Schema rules**: (1) Every table has user_id + RLS. (2) Weights in kg. (3) DATE for daily logs. (4) JSON for flexible data. (5) Soft deletes. (6) Indexes on (user_id, date). (7) No cross-user access without friendship/guild.

## Tech Stack Evolution (Section 8)
